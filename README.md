"I'm Alicia.  
This is my very first Wake Tech course.

## Websites I Recommend
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - Free for the most part,  
   providing great tutorials, documentaries, and entertainment.  
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) - Great for studying; some functions  
   include flashcards, learn, test, etc...  
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) - Horrible price, no more sharing,  
   need VPN to access the majority.  
   At least it does what I pay it to do, for the most part.
